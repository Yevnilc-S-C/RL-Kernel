# RL-Kernel

RL-Kernel (Resource Light Kernel) is a lightweight kernel which is intended to be used to learn how to optimize a kernel maximally.

## Goals

The goals of RL-Kernel are as follows:

- Lightweight kernel with support for basic commands

- Support for VGA graphics

- Support for the following CPU architectures: ARM, x86-64, and PowerPC
